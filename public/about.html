<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Michael Becton and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. This website is a continuous work in progress created 
  as a way to document my learning journey and display projects that I have created along the way.
</p>

<p>Outside of my passion of learning various aspects of the vast space we call Information Technology, I enjoy spending
  time with my family and friends, playing video games occasionally, and catching up on anime/manga.
</p>

<p>If you are interested in my services, or just want to network and build a connection, please tap the contact
  link for details. I look forward to networking with you all!
